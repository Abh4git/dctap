# DC Tabular Application Profile

## Introduction

The concept of the <em>(metadata) application profile</em> is important for DCMI and the Dublin Core community. It has underpinned many of DCMI's development efforts in recent years. There is significant community interest in developing tools to aid in creating and documenting application profiles. There is a related interest in assuring that profiles specify validation rules for the data that they define.  

Previous work in the Dublin Core community defined a [framework](/specifications/dublin-core/singapore-framework/) for application profiles and a [constraint language](http://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dc-dsp/) based on the [Dublin Core Abstract Model](http://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/abstract-model/). This current work will use some of the concepts developed previously but will not be bound to those specifications.

## A Core Vocabulary for Profiles

The idea behind this project is that there is a growing need to develop vocabularies for the creation of data and metadata. The goal of interoperability among data stores encourages the reuse of existing vocabularies for this purpose, and thus to create local profiles that can be understood as widely as possible. Some developers of applications work with complex platforms for data creation and validation. However, metadata is used by nearly every information technology function, from the simple web page to an institutional database, and many people involved in those functions are developing their metadata without the aid of complex and often expensive technology nor the use of professional data developers. This project aims to provide a simple core vocabulary that allows the reuse of elements defined in the public sphere of the web, and to assign basic constraints to those elements; a core vocabulary as simple to understand and use as Dublin Core, but with a different set of outcomes.
